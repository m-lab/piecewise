# Vectortiles

## Required tools
In addition to the things you normally need to run the `piecewise` project, you'll need the following things installed on your `PATH`. Installation instructions are in parenthesis.

1. `mapshaper` (`npm install -g mapshaper`)
1. `tippecanoe` (`brew install tippecanoe` or [other os instructions](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe#installation))

It is recommended to use the same version of Node that `piecewise` uses. Some of this workflow's dependencies are installed through the top level `package.json`.
